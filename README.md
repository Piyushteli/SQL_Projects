# SQL Project: Online Book Store
This project is a comprehensive SQL implementation of an online book store database.

# Project Overview:
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a relational database for an online book store, including tables for books, authors, customers, orders, and more.

# Topics Covered:
1. CSV Files: The project includes CSV files containing sample data for books, authors, customers, and orders.
2. SQL Queries: The project includes a wide range of SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data, including:
    - Data definition queries (CREATE, ALTER, DROP)
    - Data manipulation queries (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
    - Data retrieval queries (SELECT, JOIN, SUBQUERY)
3. SQL Project Questions: The project includes a set of questions that demonstrate the use of SQL to solve real-world problems, such as:
    - Retrieving book information
    - Analyzing customer orders
    - Identifying best-selling books

# Project Structure:
- CSV Files: Sample data files in CSV format
- SQL Queries: SQL scripts for creating and populating tables, and retrieving data
- SQL Project Questions: A set of questions that demonstrate the use of SQL to solve real-world problems

# Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository
2. Import the CSV files into your database management system (DBMS)
3. Run the SQL queries to create and populate the tables
4. Explore the SQL project questions and try to solve them on your own

# Prerequisites:
- Basic understanding of SQL and relational databases
- A database management system (DBMS) installed (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
